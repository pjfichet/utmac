Installing Neatroff
===================

This makefile will only provide a minimal neatroff installation:
it will install roff, post, pdf, mkfn, hyphenations files, and will
transfer the Linux Libertine font in a neatroff compatible format.

For a complete troff distribution based on neatroff, you
should prefer <http://github.com/aligrudi/neatroff_make>.

Dependencies
------------

You will need the Linux Libertine font. It is usually packaged
by linux distributions.

Usage
-----

You should edit the makefile to suit your needs and run:

	$ make all

That will download, build, and install roff, post, pdf, mkfn and
hyphenations files. That will also transfer the linux libertine font
in a format compatible with neatroff. The other possible targets are:

	help: short usage.
	bin: build roff, post, pdf, mkfn.
	install: install roff, post, pdf, and mkfn.
	fonts: install the linux libertine font.
	hyphen: download the hyphenation files.
	all: install everything
	clean: clean the current directory.
	uninstall: uninstall everything.

Patch
-----

A small patch (invisible_links.diff) is applied to neatpost to prevent
some viewers to surround links with a black rectangle in the produced
documents.
