The macro to define the substitution text for a link is now LT
instead of LP.

The user interface to index keywords is now completely separated
from the one used to print links. The keywords to index are now
defined by the K[x] macro. K[x] macros don’t print anything, and
the LP macro is now reserved to links.

Defined K[x] macros are KA (acronyms), KN (names), KO (objects,
things), KT (titles, books), KW (words).  It is easy to add new
ones by using the internal idx :make macro.

The macros for links are now in u-links.tmac.  LL, LM and LU now
print the link even if LP is not used.  A glitch in summaries and
table of contents has been fixed by correctly escaping \a and \t.
