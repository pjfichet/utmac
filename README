Utmac - set of troff macros for heirloom troff

The U troff macros — utmac — is a set of troff macros which uses the
typographic features of Heirloom Troff. Bibliography, indexes, table
of content and summaries can be automatically inserted.  utmac informs
about orphans, widows and blanks at the bottom of page, and provides
macros to help the user to fix them manually. utmac can produce
terminal output, high quality pdf files, ReStructuredText files, plain
text file, and clean xml files — and so, with some xsl stylesheet,
flat open document texts (fodt) and html files.
