Utmac - set of troff macros
===========================

The U troff macros — utmac — is a set of macros aiming to produce
beautiful documents easily. Bibliography, indexes, table of content
and summaries can be automatically inserted. Utmac informs about
orphans, widows and empty lines at the bottom of page. Utmac can
produce pdf files, ReStructuredText files, plain text files, and clean
xml files — and so, with some xsl stylesheet, flat open document texts
(fodt) and html files.

While historicaly Utmac was using Gunnar Ritter's troff (also called
heirloom troff), it is now using Ali Gholami Rudi's neatroff. Neatroff
is a wonderful text processor, performing a paragraph at once
adjustment, while being easy to use and install.

Usage
=====

Utmac is documented in the manual pages "utmac", "u-ref", and
"utmac-hack".  Here is only a quick reference.

The following macro files can be used by the user (called with the ‐m
option of troff):
- uh: Made with humanities in mind. It uses marginal notes instead of
  footnotes.
- ul: A macro to write letters and short texts.
- um: Translate an utmac document to manpage with nroff.
- ut: Translate an utmac document to a flat text file (such as README
  files) with nroff.
- us: Made for technical documentation. It uses a common layout,
  reminiscent of the old troff ms.
- uw: Translate an utmac document to the markdown wiki format.
- ux: Translate an utmac document to xml. This macro must be used
  with the postxml (from troffxml) post‐processor.

Additionaly, some configuration can be achieved by loading these
macros:
- u-en: English localization (default).
- u-fr: French localization.
- u-apolline: Use the Porchez Typofonderie Apolline Font.
- u-libertine: Use the Linux Libertine font.
- u-biolinum: Use the Linux Biolinum font.
- u-biolib: Use a mix of Linux Libertine and Biolinum.

So, to format a document in french with the biolinum font, you should
do:
	troff -mu-fr -mu-biolinum -mul f.tr | pdf -pA4 > f.pdf

# Dependencies

- Utmac is supposed to be used with Neatroff <http://litcave.rudi.ir>.
  The subdirectory "neatroff" contains a makefile to help you build
  a install neatroff for utmac.
- By default, Utmac uses the libertine font, which must be transferred
  in the neatroff font format. The makefile in the subdirectory "neatroff"
  will do that for you.
- To benefit of all the functions of Utmac, you can also install:
    - refer <http://github.com/pjfichet/refer>, to format bibliography
      references.
    - idx <http://github.com/pjfichet/idx>, to index keywords in your
