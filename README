Utmac - set of troff macros
===========================

The U troff macros — utmac — is a set of macros aiming to produce
beautiful documents easily. Bibliography, indexes, table of content
and summaries can be automatically inserted. Utmac informs about
orphans, widows and empty lines at the bottom of a page. It can
produce pdf files, ReStructuredText files, plain text files, and clean
xml files — and so, with some xsl stylesheet, flat open document texts
(fodt) and html files.

While historicaly Utmac was using Gunnar Ritter's troff (also called
heirloom troff), it is now using Ali Gholami Rudi's neatroff. Neatroff
is a wonderful troff implementation, performing a paragraph at once
adjustment, while being easy to use and install.

Usage
=====

Utmac is documented in the manual pages "utmac", "u-ref", and
"utmac-hack".  Here is only a quick reference.

The following macro files can be used by the user (called with the ‐m
option of troff):
- uh: Made with humanities in mind. It uses marginal notes instead of
  footnotes.
- ul: A macro to write letters and short texts.
- um: Translate an utmac document to the manpage format with nroff.
- ut: Translate an utmac document to a flat text file (such as README
  files) with nroff.
- us: Made for technical documentation. It uses a common layout,
  reminiscent of the old troff ms.
- uw: Translate an utmac document to the markdown wiki format.
- ux: Translate an utmac document to xml. This macro must be used
  with the postxml (from troffxml) post‐processor.

Additionaly, some configuration can be achieved by loading these
macros:
- u-en: English localization (default).
- u-fr: French localization.
- u-apolline: Use the Porchez Typofonderie Apolline Font.
- u-libertinus: Use the Libertinus font (default).
- u-libertine: Use the Linux Libertine font.
- u-biolinum: Use the Linux Biolinum font.
- u-biolib: Use a mix of Linux Libertine and Biolinum.

So, to format an english document, you will do:
	$ roff -mul f.tr | pdf -pa4 > f.pdf

While to format a document in french with the biolinum font, you should
do:
	$ roff -mu-fr -mu-biolinum -muh f.tr | pdf -pa4 > f.pdf

# Installation
--------------

To build and install, edit the makefile to suit your needs, and do:

    $ make
    $ make install

To uninstall, and clean this directory, do:

    $ make uninstall
    $ make clean

# Dependencies
--------------

Utmac is supposed to be used with Neatroff <http://litcave.rudi.ir>.  The
subdirectory "neatroff" contains a makefile to help you to build and install
it for the needs of utmac.

By default, Utmac uses the libertinus font, which must be transferred in the
neatroff font format. The makefile in the subdirectory "neatroff" will do that
for you.

To benefit of all the functions of Utmac, you can also install:
- refer <http://github.com/pjfichet/refer>, to format bibliography
  references.
- idx <http://github.com/pjfichet/idx>, to index keywords in your
  documents.
- ugrind <http://github.com/pjfichet/ugrind>, to highlight source
  code in your documents.
- tchars <http://github.com/pjfichet/tchars>, to write polytonic
  greek.
- troffxml <http://github.com/pjfichet/troffxml>, to convert your
  utmac documents to xml, html, and fodt.
