Utmac - set of troff macros for heirloom troff
==============================================

The U troff macros — utmac — is a set of troff macros which uses the
typographic features of Heirloom Troff. Bibliography, indexes, table
of content and summaries can be automatically inserted.  Utmac informs
about orphans, widows and blanks at the bottom of page, and provides
macros to help the user to fix them manually. Utmac can produce
terminal output, high quality pdf files, ReStructuredText files, plain
text file, and clean xml files — and so, with some xsl stylesheet,
flat open document texts (fodt) and html files.

The following macro files can be used by the user (called with the ‐m
option of troff):
- uh Made with humanities in mind. It use marginal notes instead of
  footnotes.
- ul A macro to write letters and short texts.
- um Translate an utmac document to manpage with nroff.
- ut Translate an utmac document to a flat text file (such as README
  files) with nroff.
- us Made for technical documentation. It use a common layout,
  reminiscent of the old troff ms.
- uw Translate an utmac document to the markdown wiki format.
- ux Translate an \fIutmac\fR document to xml. This macro must be used
  with the postxml (from troffxml) post‐processor.

Additionaly, some configuration can be achieved by loading these
macros:
- u-en English localization (default).
- u-fr French localization.
- u-apolline Use the Porchez Typofonderie Apolline Font.
- u-libertine Use the Linux Libertine font.
- u-biolinum Use the Linux Biolinum font.
- u-biolib Use a mix of Linux Libertine and Biolinum.
