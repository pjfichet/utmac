Makefile for Heirloom Troff
===========================

This makefile aims to ease the installation of the heirloom doctools
(<https://github.com/n-t-roof/heirloom-doctools>) for Utroff.

- It provides a safer configuration by installing everything in
  /opt/utroff. Indeed, heirloom's makefile does not have a
  `make uninstall` target. So erasing that directory is the
  simplest way to uninstall cleanly.
- It creates the needed directories (heirloom makefile does not).
- It allows to build only a subset of heirloom tools.
- It substitutes the hardcoded path indicated in the manual pages
  with the real ones.

Usage
-----

1. Edit config.mk.

2. Download the desired version (the newest github version is advised):

    make github
	# or
    make sourceforge

3. configure, build, install:

    make configure
    make build
    make install

4. Optionally clean the working directory:

    make clean

5. Using a VERY INSECURE script, you can attempt to uninstall.
   But you would probably better do it manually with `rm`.

    make uninstall
